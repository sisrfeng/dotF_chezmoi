       This document describes the format of the _l_e_s_s_k_e_y source file, which is
       used by _l_e_s_s version 582 and later.  In previous versions  of  _l_e_s_s,  a
       separate  program called _l_e_s_s_k_e_y was used to compile the _l_e_s_s_k_e_y source
       file into a format understood by _l_e_s_s.  This  compilation  step  is  no
       longer  required  and  the _l_e_s_s_k_e_y program is therefore deprecated, al‐
       though the file format remains supported by _l_e_s_s itself.

       The input file consists of one or more _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s_.  Each  section  starts
       with  a  line  that  identifies the type of section.  Possible sections
       are:

       #command
              Defines new command keys.

       #line-edit
              Defines new line-editing keys.

       #env   Defines environment variables.

       Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign  (#)  are  ignored,
       except as noted below.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD SSEECCTTIIOONN
       The command section begins with the line

       #command

       If  the command section is the first section in the file, this line may
       be omitted.  The command section consists of lines of the form:

            _s_t_r_i_n_g <whitespace> _a_c_t_i_o_n [extra-string] <newline>

       Whitespace is any sequence of one or  more  spaces  and/or  tabs.   The
       _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  the command key(s) which invoke the action.  The _s_t_r_i_n_g may
       be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15 keys.  The _a_c_t_i_o_n is
       the  name  of  the less action, from the list below.  The characters in
       the _s_t_r_i_n_g may appear literally, or be prefixed by a caret to  indicate
       a  control  key.  A backslash followed by one to three octal digits may
       be used to specify a character by its octal value.   A  backslash  fol‐
       lowed by certain characters specifies input characters as follows:

            \b   BACKSPACE   (0x08)
            \e   ESCAPE      (0x1B)
            \n   NEWLINE     (0x0A)
            \r   RETURN      (0x0D)
            \t   TAB         (0x09)

            \k  followed by a single character represents the char(s) produced
            when one of these keys is pressed:


            \kb   BACKSPACE (the BACKSPACE key)
            \kB   ctrl-BACKSPACE
            \kd   DOWN ARROW
            \kD   PAGE DOWN
            \ke   END
            \kh   HOME
            \ki   INSERT
            \kl   LEFT ARROW
            \kL   ctrl-LEFT ARROW
            \kr   RIGHT ARROW
            \kR   ctrl-RIGHT ARROW
            \kt   BACKTAB
            \ku   UP ARROW
            \kU   PAGE UP
            \kx   DELETE
            \kX   ctrl-DELETE
            \k1   F1


            A backslash followed by any other character indicates that charac‐
            ter  is  to be taken literally.  Characters which must be preceded
            by backslash include caret, space, tab and the backslash itself.

            An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a  com‐
            mand  is  entered while running _l_e_s_s, the action is performed, and
            then the extra string is parsed, just as if it were  typed  in  to
            _l_e_s_s.   This  feature  can  be used in certain cases to extend the
            functionality of a command.  For example, see  the  "{"  and  ":t"
            commands  in  the  example  below.  The extra string has a special
            meaning for the "quit" action: when _l_e_s_s quits, the first  charac‐
            ter of the extra string is used as its exit status.

       Commands specified by _l_e_s_s_k_e_y take precedence  over  the  default  com‐
       mands.   A  default  command key may be disabled by including it in the
       input file with the action "invalid".  Alternatively, a key may be  de‐
       fined to do nothing by using the action "noaction".  "noaction" is sim‐
       ilar to "invalid", but _l_e_s_s will give an error beep  for  an  "invalid"
       command,  but  not  for a "noaction" command.  In addition, ALL default
       commands may be disabled by adding this control line to the input file:

       #stop

       This will cause all default commands to be  ignored.   The  #stop  line
       should be the last line in that section of the file.

       Be  aware  that #stop can be dangerous.  Since all default commands are
       disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the #stop line to
       enable all necessary actions.  For example, failure to provide a "quit"
       command can lead to frustration.

       The line-editing section begins with the line:

       #line-edit

       This section specifies new key bindings for the line editing  commands,
       in  a  manner similar to the way key bindings for ordinary commands are
       specified in the #command section.  The line-editing  section  consists
       of a list of keys and actions, one per line as in the example below.

       The environment variable section begins with the line

       #env

       Following this line is a  list  of  environment  variable  assignments.
       Each  line consists of an environment variable name, an equals sign (=)
       and the value to be assigned to the environment variable.  White  space
       before  and  after  the  equals sign is ignored.  Variables assigned in
       this way are visible only to _l_e_s_s.  If a variable is specified  in  the
       system environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the lesskey
       file takes precedence.

       If the variable name is followed by += rather than =, the string is ap‐
       pended  to the variable's existing value.  This currently works only if
       any += lines immediately follow the same variable's original definition
       (with  an  =  line), without any intervening definitions of other vari‐
       ables.  It can append only to a variable defined earlier in  the  file;
       it cannot append to a variable in the system environment.

       If  a line begins with #version followed by a relational operator and a
       version number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and only if  the
       running version of _l_e_s_s (or _l_e_s_s_k_e_y) matches the operator.  This can be
       helpful if a lesskey file is used by different versions of _l_e_s_s.

       For example, suppose that a  new  command  named  'sideways-search'  is
       added  in  _l_e_s_s  version 777.  Then the following line would assign the
       command to the Q key, but only in versions of _l_e_s_s  which  support  it.
       The line would be ignored by versions earlier than 777.

                 #version >= 777  Q sideways-search

       These six operators are supported:

             >    Greater than
             <    Less than

             >=   Greater than or equal to
             <=   Less than or equal to
             =    Equal to
             !=   Not equal to

       The  #version  feature is not supported in _l_e_s_s and _l_e_s_s_k_e_y before ver‐
       sion 594.  In those older versions, all #version lines are ignored.

       On  MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of characters
       which start with a NUL character (0).  This  NUL  character  should  be
       represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
