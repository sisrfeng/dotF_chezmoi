       _l_e_s_s_e_c_h_o  is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard out‐
       put.  But any metacharacter in the output is preceded  by  an  "escape"
       character, which by default is a backslash.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       A summary of options is included below.

       --eexx    Specifies  "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for
              metachars.  If x is "-", no escape char is  used  and  arguments
              containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.

       --ooxx    Specifies  "x",  rather  than double-quote, to be the open quote
              character, which is used if the -e- option is specified.

       --ccxx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       --ppnn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer.

       --ddnn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer.

       --mmxx    Specifies "x" to be a metachar.  By default, no  characters  are
              considered metachars.

       --nnnn    Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.

       --ffnn    Specifies  "n"  to be the escape char for metachars, as an inte‐
              ger.

       --aa     Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted.  The  default  is
              that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted.
